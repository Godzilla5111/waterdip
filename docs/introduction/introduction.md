# **Introduction to Waterdip**

Waterdip is an Open Source ML Observability platform that allows ML Engineers and data scientists to observe their models' performance at scale.

Waterdip allows you to monitor your model's performance in real-time. It also provides a dashboard that lets you track key metrics like accuracy, speed, cost, etc. The platform also gives you historical data about your modelâ€™s performance so you can compare it against different timelines.

### **Connect anything, anywhere**
Waterdip is an Open Platform  that works with your machine-learning infrastructure. We're model and platform agnostic, and 100% API-first.

We make it easy to integrate with the tools of your choice; whether that's TensorFlow or Caffe2 or PyTorch or TensorFlow or any other framework you prefer.
